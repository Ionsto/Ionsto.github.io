        I became interested in programming from a really young age.<br>
        I used to play games like Red Alert - and wonder how cool it would be if X did Y? Or if this tank had bigger guns? I decided that i would try and understand what happened "under the hood".
        <br>
        <br>
        I also had a love of simulations - games where i could sit back and watch it <i>go</i>!
        <br>
        My first language was C.<br>
        C was a mistake.
        <br>
        <br>
        My second language was BASIC.
